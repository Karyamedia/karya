## Installation

I've make this project available to install via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) with following command:

```bash
$ composer create-project -s dev karyamedia/karya my-app
```

now enter `my-app` directory you just create then copy and rename `env.txt` file to `.env` under **app** directory.

```bash
$ cp app/env.txt app/.env
```

then edit contents of `app/.env` file as you wish. When everything is done, let's start the server.

**NOTE**: Make sure your Redis server already running.
